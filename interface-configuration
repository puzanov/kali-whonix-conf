Kali VM network need to be virtual with "Whonix" name

/etc/network/interfaces
iface eth0 inet static
      address 10.152.152.11
      netmask 255.255.192.0
      gateway 10.152.152.10

Replace the entire contents of /etc/resolv.conf with the following:
nameserver 10.152.152.10

Bounce the interface inside Kali:
sudo ifdown eth0
sudo ifup eth0

If the eth0 interface was down, than up it, make it down and up it up for working
